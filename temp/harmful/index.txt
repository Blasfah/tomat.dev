Things Considered Harmful
=========================

To quote <https://harmful.cat-v.org/>: "The world is full of things that most people think are OK or even good, when in reality are either evil or plain stupid."

If you'd like to get meta ("'Considered Harmful' Essays Considered Harmful"): <http://meyerweb.com/eric/comment/chech.html>
There are lots of things that irk me, and writing about them is something I've wanted to do for some time.
I have done my fair share of ranting into the void or into chat rooms without every properly recording my thoughts, so here we are.
These are, my design, "hit pieces" that make it hard for actual debates to occur, so contact me @ @tomat:matrix.org, Tomat#0001, or xxlennygamerxx@gmail.com.
